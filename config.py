    # Input image resizing
    # Generally, use the "square" resizing mode for training and predicting
    # and it should work well in most cases. In this mode, images are scaled
    # up such that the small side is = IMAGE_MIN_DIM, but ensuring that the
    # scaling doesn't make the long side > IMAGE_MAX_DIM. Then the image is
    # padded with zeros to make it a square so multiple images can be put
    # in one batch.
    # Available resizing modes:
    # none:   No resizing or padding. Return the image unchanged.
    # square: Resize and pad with zeros to get a square image
    #         of size [max_dim, max_dim].
    # pad64:  Pads width and height with zeros to make them multiples of 64.
    #         If IMAGE_MIN_DIM or IMAGE_MIN_SCALE are not None, then it scales
    #         up before padding. IMAGE_MAX_DIM is ignored in this mode.
